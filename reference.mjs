@Title: Nota Reference

This page explains the basics of Nota's language syntax and component library. You can either edit the examples here interactively, or you can follow the instructions on the [home page](/) to install Nota and edit files on your own computer. 

@TableOfContents

@Section: Syntax

A Nota document is text mixed with commands, typically contained in a \`.nota\` file. A Nota document looks like this:

@InlineEditor|{
% let sysname = "Nota"

@Section: #sysname: A Document Language for the Browser

#(sysname.toUpperCase()) is my *favorite* way to write [documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document)!
}|

@Wrap[align: "right"]:
  @Figure[name: "markdown_examples"]:
    | Command | Output |
    | ------- | ------- |
    | \`*italics*\`| *italics* |
    | \`**bold**\` | **bold** |
    | \`[link](url)\` | [link](url) |
    | \`# Header\` | @h2{Header} |
    | \`* list\` | @ul{@li{list}} |
    
    @Caption: Examples of Markdown @br{} supported by Nota.
    
Nota syntax is based on [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), specifically [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) with some [Github Flavored extensions](https://github.github.com/gfm/). In the example above, \`*favorite*\` becomes *favorite*. Some examples of Markdown features are shown in &markdown_examples.

The major difference between Nota and traditional Markdown is that Nota enables you to use Javascript in your document. There are three kinds of Javascript in the example above:
1. Javascript components with \`@\`, e.g. to use a custom section header \`@Section\`.
2. Javascript statements with \`%\`, e.g. to define variables like \`sysname\`.
3. Javascript expressions with \`#\`, e.g. to put the value of \`sysname\` in the header.

Next, we will explore how each of these features works.

@Subsection: @-commands

Markdown supports a fixed set of components: bold, italics, headers, lists, and so on. But what if you want to use a component that wasn't built in, like an interactive chart? Then you can use a custom component, like \`@VegaLite\` from the [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) package:

% import data from "./data/unemployment-across-industries.json"
@InlineEditor[imports: {"./data/unemployment-across-industries.json": data}]|{
%%%
// Chart from: https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/interactive_legend.html
import values from "./data/unemployment-across-industries.json";
let spec = {
  data: {values}, mark: "area",
  params: [{name: "industry", select: {type: "point", fields: ["series"]}, bind: "legend"}],
  encoding: {
    x: {timeUnit: "yearmonth", field: "date", axis: {domain: false, format: "%Y", tickSize: 0}},
    y: {aggregate: "sum", field: "count", stack: "center", "axis": null},
    color: {field: "series", scale: {scheme: "category20b"}},
    opacity: {condition: {param: "industry", value: 1}, value: 0.2},
  }
};
%%%

Try clicking on the legend!

@VegaLite[spec]
}|

If there isn't a component that does exactly what you want, then you can write your own using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). For example, here's a component that lets users interactively change the text color of the component's children:

@InlineEditor|{
%%%
import {useState} from "react";
let ColorPicker = ({children}) => {
  let [color, setColor] = useState("red");
  let onClick = () => setColor(color == "red" ? "blue" : "red");
  return @div{
    @button[onClick]{Toggle color} ---
    @span[style: {color}]{#children}
  };
}
%%%

@ColorPicker:
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
}|

At its core, a component has a name (required), a set of attributes (optional), and a sequence of children components (optional). One of Nota's goals is to make it reasonably concise to write components, so there are several syntaxes for writing components. They are:

@InlineEditor|{  
% let Component = () => @div[style: {color: "red"}]{Hello world};
// A name is either a JS identifier...
@Component
// ...or a parenthesized JS expression.
@([Component][0])

// Attributes are written in either square brackets...
% let Duplicate = ({content}) => @div{#content#content};
@Duplicate[content: @{Hello}]
// ...or pipes (only for attributes that take components as input).
@Duplicate:
  | content: Hello

// Children can be delimited in curly braces...
@div{Hello world}
// ...or placed after a colon on one line...
@div: Hello world
// ...or placed indented on a newline after a colon.
@div:
  Hello world

// Putting it all together:
@("di" + "v")[style: {color: "red"}]:
  Hello world
}|

If you want to learn more about how to write React components, I recommend following a React tutorial such as: <https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html>

@Subsubsection: Inline vs. block

One tricky part about using Nota components is how they integrate with Markdown parsing. Markdown is very sensitive to indentation and newlines. For example:

@InlineEditor|{
*   Example 1: this list starts an indentation,
    matching newlines are part of the same item,

    even after empty lines.
  
  But reducing the indentation breaks the list!

**Example 2: you can't bold

over multiple lines.**
}|

In short, Markdown (and CSS) distinguishes *block* and *inline* elements. Block elements are things like headers, lists, and paragraphs --- they generally take the full width of the page, and stack vertically. Inline elements are things like text, styled text (bold / italics / strikethrough), hyperlinks, and buttons --- they flow together horizontally in a sequence.

In Markdown, an empty line is used to delimit inline sequences. So in the example above, the bolding doesn't work because an empty line separates the initial \`**\` from the final \`**\`. This fact means that a program like this would not make sense:

\`\`\`nota
Hello @span{

  world
}.
\`\`\`

Therefore Nota currently has the following restriction. If a component is in inline position, then its contents MUST not contain any empty newlines. 

Another issue arises over whether a Nota command should be treated as a block or inline element. For example, consider these two programs:

\`\`\`nota
@div{Hello world}

@span{Hello} world
\`\`\`

The first line should compile into a block element, i.e. a standalone div. The second line should compile into a paragraph that contains the span and the remainder of the text. But this means that the parser doesn't know whether a component is inline or not until reading past the component.

For now, to resolve this ambiguity, the parser assumes that all components at the beginning of a line are block components. You can explicitly indicate that such a component is an inline component by adding a period before @, e.g.

\`\`\`nota
.@span{Hello} world
\`\`\`

@Subsection{\\%-commands}

Markdown allows you to write rich text, but it doesn't support any kind of programming. Programming can be useful when writing a document, for example:

@InlineEditor|{
% let sysname = "Nota"
I named my system #sysname. But if I decide to rename #sysname later, then I can just change the variable!

% let outlives = macro{#1 :> #2}
I have a common pattern in my document, like a math formula $#outlives{r_1}{r_2}$. So I can use it in equations like:

$$
#outlives{r_1}{r_2} \\wedge #outlives{r_2}{r_3} \\implies #outlives{r_1}{r_3}
$$

%%% 
let features = [
  {title: "Feature 1", text: "Is great!"},
  {title: "Feature 2", text: "Is even better!"},
  {title: "Feature 3", text: "You're not gonna believe it."}
]
%%%

I have a common structure to my content. So I can encode it in a data structure and write my UI once:

@Row[style: {gap: '1em'}]:
  #(features.map(({title, text}) => 
    @div{**#title** @br #text}))
}|

\\%-commands allow you to embed Javascript statements in your document. There are two syntaxes: \`%\` for a one-line statement, and \`%%%\` for multi-line statements. A \\%-command does not change the visual display of your document --- it only defines data that will be available as the document renders.

You can write any ES6 Javascript (e.g. arrow functions, ESM-style imports, etc.) within a %-command, or any place that Nota permits Javascript (like component attributes). Nota also extends Javascript with two new features:

**Nota-in-JS:** You can also use Nota components within Javascript. Anywhere you would write a Javascript expression, you can also write a Nota-component. For example:

@InlineEditor|{
% let x = @div{Hello world!};
#x
}|

Note that the outer-most Nota component within a Javascript expression must use curly-brace delimiters for children (not colons).

**Macros:** When working with components that take complex string inputs such as $\\KaTeX$, it's useful to have concisely define string-generating macros. Nota adds a new keyword \`macro\` that works like this:

@InlineEditor|{
% let implies = macro{#1 \\Rightarrow #2}
$(\\neg a \\vee b) \\iff (#implies{a}{b})$
}|

This macro is syntactic sugar for:

\`\`\`javascript
let implies = (arg1, arg2) => \`\${arg1} \\Rightarrow \${arg2}\`;
\`\`\`

@Subsection{\\#-commands}

With the ability to define variables, you need the ability to use them! A \\#-command has three roles:

@InlineEditor|{
% let name = "Nota"
You can use \\# to embed a variable like #name in the document.

% let implies = macro{#1 \\Rightarrow #2}
You can use \\# to call a function, like \`implies\`:

$(\\neg a \\vee b) \\iff (#implies{a}{b})$

You can use \\# to embed an arbitrary Javascript expression, like a map over a list:

#(["a", "b"].map(s => @div{#s}))
}|

This is a non-exhaustive list of some components that are provided in Nota's standard library.

Nota provides \`@Definition\` and \`@Ref\` components for defining things and referencing them in a general way. For example:

@InlineEditor|{
@Definition[name: "nota", label: "Nota"]: Nota is a document language for the browser.

Have you tried writing &nota?
}|

A definition has four pieces:

1. \`name\`: required, string by which to reference this definition.
2. \`label\`: optional, element that is shown (by default) for a reference to this definition.
3. \`tooltip\`: optional, element to show when a reference to this definition is clicked (by default the definition's body).
4. The definition body.

A reference's text argument is the definition's name. Because references are common in documents, Nota provides a shorthand for writing references: \`&def_name\` (because you're making a pointer to something!). You can optionally define the content of the reference:

@InlineEditor|{
@Definition[name: "nota"]: Nota is a document language for the browser.

Have you tried writing @Ref[label: @{**Nota**}]{nota}?
}|

@Subsection: Math / TeX

Nota provides inline and block math elements, \`$\` and \`$$\` respectively. Currently these use the [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) library for rendering.

@InlineEditor|{
The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for all vectors $u$ and $v$ of an inner product space it is true that

% let u = #{\\mathbf{u}}; let v = #{\\mathbf{v}};
% let vec = macro{\\langle #1, #2 \\rangle};

$$
 | #vec{u}{v} |^2 \\leq #vec{u}{u} \\cdot #vec{v}{v}
$$
}|

While you can use TeX macros if necessary, it is recommended to use Javascript variables and functions as shown above. Macros are only essential for referencing TeX builtins such as \`\\leq\` for \`\\leq\`.

The KaTeX integration for Nota provides special support for definitions and references. For example:

@InlineEditor|{
% let reaches = macro{#texRef{reaches}{#1 ~ \\mathsf{reaches} ~ #2}};

@Definition[name: "reaches"]:
  The judgment $#reaches{n_1}{n_2}$ is defined as:  

  @div:
    @IR[Bot: @\${#reaches{n}{n}}]
  
    @IR:
      | Top: 
        @Premise: $#reaches{n_1}{n_2}$
        @Premise: $#reaches{n_2}{n_3}$
      | Bot: $#reaches{n_1}{n_3}$
}|

Nota provides the function \`texRef\` for TeX code which refers to a Nota definition, such as \`reaches\` here. Then any reference to the $\\mathsf{reaches}$ judgment via the \`reaches\` function will support definition-reference features: click to see the definition, and double-click to jump to it.

@Subsection: Code

Nota uses [Codemirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/) for code editing and viewing. For example:

@InlineEditor[imports: {"@codemirror/lang-rust": langRust}]|{
% import {rust} from "@codemirror/lang-rust"
\`\`\`rust
fn char_at(s: &str, i: usize) -> char {
  s.chars().nth(i).unwrap()
}
\`\`\`
}|

Note that you need to import the corresponding \`lang\` package to get the right syntax highlighting.

@Subsection: Citations

The \`@References\` component takes as input [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) string (usually imported from a \`.bib\` file) and does two things:

1. It creates a \`@Definition\` for each citation where the \`name\` is the one provided in bibtex.
2. It shows the references of all citations used in the document.

For example:

@InlineEditor|{
Nota is a document language for the browser &crichton2021nota.

    booktitle={Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Human Aspects of Types and Reasoning Assistants},
    year={2021}
  }
}
}|

@Section: Styling

Nota components do not have much default styling to allow authors greater flexibility in their own designs. To add your own styling, you can use CSS. For example, directly via a style tag:

@InlineEditor|{ 
@style{ span.text-red { color: red; } }

% let Red = ({children}) => @span[className: "text-red"]{#children}

I love the color @Red{red!}
}|

You can also import an external stylesheet. For example, Nota provides a set of themes. The current list of Nota themes: is:

* [\`@nota-lang/nota-theme-acm\`](https://github.com/nota-lang/nota/tree/master/packages/nota-theme-acm): emulates the latest [ACM LaTeX](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) conference paper theme.
* (...That's it so far! If you make your own theme, we can add it to this list.)

To use a theme, you simply import its CSS, such as:

\`\`\`nota
% import "@nota-lang/nota-theme-acm/dist/index.css"
\`\`\`
