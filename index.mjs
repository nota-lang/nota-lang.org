@Definition[name: "nota", label: nota]:
  #nota is a language for writing documents, like academic papers and blog posts.
  The goal of #nota is to 
  **bring documents into the #(20 + 1)st century.**

Documents contain a lot of structure --- for example, "&nota" is a reference to a term defined in the preceding paragraph. &nota enables authors to *represent* that structure, which allows the reading medium (the browser) to *understand* that structure, which in turn empowers readers to *use* that structure. Try clicking on any "&nota" reference to see this idea in action. (Then try double-clicking!)

A &nota document compiles to a JavaScript program, meaning it's easy to:

* View documents on any device that has a web browser.
* Use variables, functions, and data structures to simplify document writing.
* Integrate with JavaScript libraries like [KaTeX](https://katex.org/), [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), and [Penrose](https://github.com/penrose/penrose).
* Support accessibility needs like screen readers.`),(0,e.createElement)(g,{name:"usage"},"Usage"),(0,e.createElement)("p",{},"You can use Nota by installing the ",(0,e.createElement)("code",{},"nota")," executable via the ",(0,e.createElement)("code",{},"@nota-lang/nota")," package.

PDFs were designed to mirror physical documents, so they impose the real-world constraints of paper: page breaks, fixed width, and immutable styling. Web pages, by contrast, provides an essential dynamism. Web pages can be dynamically formatted: resized for phones, translated into other languages, colors changed for color-blindness. Web pages can be dynamically interactive: text prompted for more context, diagrams shifted for a new perspective, annotations added for posterity. Web pages are undeniably the future of digital documents."),(0,e.createElement)("p",{},"But currently, that dynamism is only accessible to professional web developers.
